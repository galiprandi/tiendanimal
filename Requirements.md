## 1. TODO CRUD

Use the following design for an application and convert it into code.

Figma document (If you don't have a Figma account, you can create one to edit and use the elements).

### Tools:

- [TODOs Figma] (If you don't have a Figma account you can create one to interact with the elements)
- [TODO API REST Dummy]. Use it to load, add.. todos.

### Features:

- The main view, 'Task List', should initially load 3 'todo' items from the dummy REST API.
- Additionally, you will need to implement the ability to Add/Delete new TODOs in to a 'My Tasks' section, which will be done through the form in the second view 'Add Task'.

### Delivery

Upload the project to a git public repo with some Readme instructions o execute it and so on. Send us the link!

### Tech stack

You can use any stack you prefer as long as the requirements are met.

### Highly valued

- Form Validations
- Error handling
- CI/CD pipelines
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Good readme documentation about the code and infra.
- Pagination on the TODOs
